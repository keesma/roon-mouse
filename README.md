# roon-mouse
Process mouse events and send commands to roon (pause, play, change volume, next prev)

A python script to process mouse events and send commands to Roon 
The mouse was connected to my Raspberry Pi.

The script can be extended so you can also select the music player you want to select.
Currently the music player is hardcoded.
