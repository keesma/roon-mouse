# roon-mouse
Process mouse events and send commands to the roon music player (pause, play, change volume, next and previous track)

A python script to process mouse events and send commands to Roon 
The mouse was connected to my Raspberry Pi.
The volume can be chaged with the mouse wheel.

The script can be extended so you can also select the music player you want to select.
Currently the music player is hardcoded.

Uses https://github.com/st0g1e/roon-extension-http-api to send commands to the roon player.
